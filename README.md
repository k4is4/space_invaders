# Introduction
This is a project we did during the Python Programming course to practice how to use classes. I had studied classes before but by doing this project I learned how to really use them in my code. I used **Python 3.9.10** and **Pygame 2.1.2** to build the game.


Space Invaders is a game where you try to shoot all the aliens before they hit your ship or the bottom of the screen. Everytime you manage to kill all the aliens the speed increases and the game gets more difficult.


# How to Play
1. Make sure you have **python** and **pip** installed.
2. Create and activate your virtual environment, unless you prefer a different setup.
3. Download the repository as a zip file and unzip it, or clone the repo to a local directory.
4. From the command prompt, install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Start the game by running the **main.py** file: `python main.py`.

Click the **PLAY button** to start. **Right arrow** moves the ship to the right and **left arrow** to the left. **Space** shoots bullets. You can quit the game by pressing **q** or **esc**.
